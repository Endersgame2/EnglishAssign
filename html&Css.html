  <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>

Web development is not only about writing code and publishing a website it is more about the journey and experiences that a programmer feels midway. Today I will explain HTML and CSS. If I have to explain it in simple words; Let's relate it to a human body which consists of bone structure, muscles, veins on it, and then skin with some human features that create our body, and here we have HTML acting as a bone structure for our website and CSS is the skin which distinguishes everything. This was a brief introduction to HTML and CSS. I’m going to discuss more important features of both HTML and CSS underneath. <br><br>

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language which is simply a markup language. In HTML we use tags to start out HTML code as &lt;html>, and whenever <br> we are done writing our code we need to close that certain tag. These days IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is very smart but we still <br> need to close it for the sake of confirmation, that It will run fine everywhere. These tags usually close as &lt;/tag> and in this case, it will be &lt;/html>. <br><br>

Now we know what tags are and how it’s used, but we need to put something into tags to make our website spinal cord attached to the arms, legs, <br> bones, and these are the elements that help us to connect them together as we use &lt;h1> as header and the lowest the header the greater the font size.<br> We use &lt;p> for paragraph and &lt;br> as break these are the three major get starter elements in HTML. Now we know how to make a heading and how to<br> write a paragraph using tags but it's not complete yet; as it needs a perfect image to make it work and to insert images and other stuff from different places<br>we use HTML attributes it could be a <img> tag with src to insert an image and it could be a link attached to it with a href tag as it is written as &lt;a href=” link for the next website”> and don't forget to close this tag as &lt;/a>. Just for the sake of knowledge &lt;p> and &lt;div> are two commonly used block elements that we use to separate stuff in blocks as different paragraphs as an example.<br><br>

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Now we know how to make something appear on our browser that no one wants to see as it’s just black and white text with some images. Let's start our creativity, the first and biggest question you might be asking is, do we need to go through everything to change the HTML element’s color?  the answer is NO, we can simply use CSS selectors to target a particular element and we can declare a color, font, size, and a lot more to it. CSS rules are for grouping multiple tags and making changes to them. CSS values can be numbers, Integers, or could be positive, negative they could be in px or em. These are just units to make changes in the style.<br><br>
