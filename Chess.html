  <h1>Chess Strategy Guide</h1><br><br>
  <p> <b> Why do you need a strategy?</b> <br>

    Chess was developed back 1500 years ago with the same 32 pieces and 64 squares on board. So, the Strategy of playing is the only distributing factor for your win rate. Chess is majorly played in four styles. <br>
    &#8226;Bullet <br>
    &#8226;Blitzz <br>
    &#8226;Rapid <br>
    &#8226;Classic <br> 
    
    The bullet is the fastest and the game ends in under a minute, if you are thinking of spending a min a move; you are technically lost at the first move. That’s the reason You need a strategy. <br> <br>

    <b>What are some common strategies?</b><br>>
    
    Now You know why you need a strategy, Here I will discuss some of the most famous strategies but let’s just divide the entire game into <br> three major chunks; <br>
    &#8226;Opening <br>
    &#8226;Mid-game <br>
    &#8226;End-game <br>
    
    One of the most famous strategies is using traps in opening and this is most common in bullet and blitz everyone is short on time you just need to <br> cram a few opening lines and you can get opponents, king, very easily, might be in 2 moves on a good day. <br>
        On a personal note, I use opening traps a lot in online bullet as it decides the game result really quickly. If it worked it’s good rather I simply resign to focus on my next game and grab more points. <br> <br>
    
        <b>Strategies to stay on Bord for Long games?</b> <br>
    
    There will always be one point in your chess carries when you will face a player who will play his 9 hours classic in 9 hours and it forces you to be there for the next 9 hours; It becomes really difficult when you don’t have any patience and your opponent is taking his time. You just need to stay calm and leave the board until he makes a move just roam around the tournament hall eat something or you can watch someone else’s game and when he makes a move stay calm go-to board takes your time, there is no rush you still got 3 hours on your clock and you can repeat the same; by doing this, this will create more pressure on your opponent’s mind and gives you a higher chance of winning. <br> <br>
