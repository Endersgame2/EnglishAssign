  <h1>The Snapchat Thief</h1><br><br>

In this social world, we are all exposed to the Internet. There’s a very famous phrase “either you shut everything down and put in an almirah or you will be hacked.” I had worked quite a while learning Metasploit and hacking. There, I had realized that If a hacker wants to hack you! You can be hacked all depending on his skills; still, you got some ways to try and make his task difficult.

    I will explain this with an example, suppose you got a password  1234 and a hacker who is using kali will simply use a rainbow table and get that password<br> in just .001second; where if you would choose something like v.p`#Ep>]6\7a@7z then you can be sure that it will take quite a while to get there.<br> Thus, I will suggest always make your passwords strong enough. Try not to save your passwords everywhere, try not to repeat passwords everywhere;<br> as if someone can catch your Gmail it’s more than likely that he/she will try to get into your bank account. <br><br>


Password is the key to everything and we keep lock everywhere but always keep key with us so you can save usernames, emails, numbers, if you can<br>, remove, berthings very often but always keep your password up to you. These days website developers are very smart; they know the hazards if<br>someone got hacked. That’s why they try to get up with new ideas. Back in 2018 phisher pages were on the boom; most of the time you don't realize the URL of the website you are entering your credentials; that is the point where the hacker wins. If you still want to give it a try you can try on zshadow.<br><br>


 Snapchat was the first app that came up with an amazing concept to refresh the screen every time someone tries any password. It doesn't seem too great but the reason behind this was; when a hacker run some sort of automated password attack; and whenever that script feels a change in the victim deice it usually stops and when the loop refreshes every time a password fills in, this will end up the automation of the script and a human can’t try trillions of different combinations; that was the end when Snapchat got rid of hackers. Remember the phrase, nothing is completely protected on this internet so be wise and choose your password wisely.<br><br>
